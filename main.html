<h2>We're expanding</h2>
<p> We are expanding the sites posts, we're going to cover more than the D&D club and cover our personal campaign, one shots and one page RPGs we play, different livestreams. These will each have their own sections not to clutter up the main page. We are also working on a forum so everyone can share their own D&D experiences and disscuss what goes on here. Please bare with us as we bring these to you as its going to get slow for a while.</p>

<h2>14/03/2019</h2>
<p> Merging to sessions into one post again because it's much nicer. So for the first session of the two we had half the party missing but I had someone who was willing to play them. I got the party to decide on where they wanted to go out of the two choices. They decided to head to a bustling tourist city known for its great abbey. When they arrive it is mid afternoon and one of our party wants to head to the local boat museum ~sigh~ this wasn't something I had prepared for so i was pulling it out of my arse. I knew his plan, he wanted to destroy a boat because i wouldn't allow him to originally, so they get to the museum which was closed because of date and time. I got them all to roll stealth and most of them got in without issue so I describe the boat museum to be like a dock with old boats sitting there. The moment he here's this he tries to do fire bolt, I describe how it pings off an invisible force field, he then asks to hit it with a weapon, and like when gimelly tries to destroy the ring it sends him backwards. He deides that if he can't use weapons he'll attack by hand and starts to walk towards the boat. I, at this point was enjoying making him suffer, tell him there's an invisble force field and he can't do magic. I rolled to check for guards and sure enough there was so everyone had to hide, only the player who had been attacking these boats was able to hide leading to everyone else getting captred. It is now part of his backstory that he liked to destroy ships, to replace the whole being enslaved by humans thing which he didn't ask me about. He eventually gets caught and they are escorted back out side. At this point I let them know its about 10 pm and the towns is starting to sleep, they decided to find an inn for the night, i let them know about the maps that are up all around the city. on expection it has all roads leading to the centre of the town which is a massive circle with a big cathedral in the centre. sorta like lumiose but not a big tower.  it has a list of inns on the side and prices, the inns closer to the cathedral cost more and the one the furthest out in what looks like a shady area is only 5 gold a night. As I hoped they took the cheap option not wanting to spend 80 gold a night.As they walk down to the inn it got to 11pm showing how far away it was, they get stopped a bit from the inn. A voice speaks to them from a dark alleyway talking about the abby being corrupted, my players being the great people they are wanted to attack him. i tell them how as they attempt to fire a arrow it just dissapered, you can hear it hit the ground however. they eventually give up attempting to kill the strange man and head to the inn. the inn itself is partially run down but allround a good room in the end. When they wake up they head to the abby to see what it was all about. whne they entered the men at the doors take off all their weapons and show them to their seats at the front of the abby there is a black cloth set up and it seems hastiyl put up. the voice coming from the front sounds familliar and after 5 minutes of arguing it let them know its the voice of the spirit from another realm that attacked them on the ship.<p>

<h2>28/02/2019</h2>
<p>So I help out at a lunch time club centered around D&D at my school. We have 55 minutes for lunch and normally get about 40 minutes of play time in. I do this with 3 other DMs and we each are running different campaigns.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Me = homemade campaign nicknamed ghost cult</p>
<p></p>
<p>CR/Club Runner = water deep dragon heist</p>
<p></p>
<p>DM = home made Greek campaign</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I wasnt able to do the previous sessions post because of time and then we had half term so no session. In this post I'm combining the two previous sessions, so let me begin with my campaign.

At our last session one of the party was away on a trip and as they were about to head into the boss battle for the first oneshot I didn't want to do it without anyone. Because of this I decided I'd run Jason Stathams big vacation which I thought everyone would enjoy and at the beginning when the CRs group only had the one person we planned to combine groups and I'll do it for both groups play CR. However just as they came to sit down the other two from their group arrived and they went off to do theirs.

Jason Stathams big vacation is still runnable with 3 players so I tried to carry on. This is where it all seemed to go wrong we had 1 on their phone the other blind to the fact that the game let's you do literally anything and the other wanted to play, For that week he was my favourite. So halfway through the person who was blind to it all got up, took their character sheet and sat down at CRs table. At that moment the dude on his phone decided to tell everyone that this was his last session. I kinda got bored after that point as I couldn't run anything and instead worked on the upcoming boss fight.

This session we had a new member join us, they had planned to come earlier but we're busy I whipped out the character sheet that I made for them and brought them into the campaign. At the moment they play a high elf druid but that's subject to change. For the first half we still had the guy who said he'd left but he did leave. Our new member was also accompanied by a friend of ours who offered to teach them how to play as we go on. So this is what happened, as the party stood on the deck of the ship with bodies left right and centre a noise came from inside of the mast. A faint clapping sound and as it got louder a physical form seemed to come from the mast, a tall figure with flowing hair. Around her neck was a key, she did not remember owning a key but assumed it came from the mast.

As she emerged she looked around and at the end of the bow of the ship she could see a similar key. She told everyone about this who had previously tried to break into the captains quarters, it seemed to be protected by magic. One of the other party members went out to get it and due to the previous stormy days it was hard and she almost fell off. On her way back down she was able to slide down the bow and onto deck. She tried to use the key to unlock the lock on the door but it didn't seem to work fully, the party decided to try the other key to only get the same effect. This is when the only male in our group decided to look for a second lock, before realising it was big enough for two keys and yanked it from their owners and unlocked and opened the door.

As he opened the door he saw familiar boots, then trousers, then torso he knew what he was looking at and how it was useless to look up top as the Captains head was chopped of a day ago but he did anyway. Only to find a purple firey wisp with 2 yellow streaks for eyes. As soon as the door had opened it started to speak in a snarling rough voice "what was it this body said, look after her for me? She could of told us everything and saved herself but she chose her boat instead." At that point it grabbed the sword from the desk and imitated combat from behind the party an arrow cane flying hitting the creature then a sword then some magic that made the room half as big due to the ice taking up the other half. The wispy creature turned to the man who opened the door said some Latin and burned dimmer. 

In the eyes of the man who opened the door there was now a purple fire and he took out his sword and attempted to attack another but by the sheer terrible accuracy of the host he missed. At that point another arrow flew through the crowd hitting the creatures side but not landing, then a ray of frost was sent towards the creature who took out his sword and sliced back at that point a final arrow flew making it fall flat and the purple wispy flame thing disappeared.

On the desk of the captain was a scroll with a red seal. On it was written the party's names including there new member. On the other side it said, you will know how to use it, and tell your new friend sneak into boats at night to not get caught. On the inside was a map with glowing red crosses. That is where we ended finishing the first one shot in the series.

On the CRs table things were much slower. He had one person who was rarely there, one who wasn't very creative and one who was pretty hyper. In their session before half term they spent 40 minutes going to a single shop, in their session after half term they started an infiltration on the zhentarim base.

On the other DMs table their party had met two farmers and one member who was disliked by the group tried to Shah everyone and everything including one of the farmers wives, in the same room as the farmer. This session they had taken up a job by the farmers, some bandits had been annoying the farmers and had to be dealt with. So the party no longer including the sex crazed member went out to sort out these bandits who probably knowing the DM called the party chuff Muppets.

This has been the previous two sessions.</P>

<h2>20/12/2018</h2>
<p>If you are reading this then that means you have some understanding of how to play dungeons and dragons, or at least what it is. I myself have been playing for little under a year now and have DM'd for two groups. Early into the school year a Friend of mine and the guy who got me into D&D said to me he wanted to run a club at lunchtimes for D&D. As I was already running a club I offered to help out, and so he got to work running clubs was somewhat uncommon for people of our year but we were both trusted individuals and granted the permission. I was never too sure what he wanted to do with the club on the beginning so I suggested some of my own ideas. After a few weeks of work we had created a presentation to last us a bit about playing D&D or so we thought, we had to cut the first 2 weeks of it short due to us not having enough stuff. We had eventually got enough for a full lunchtime, this being 55 minutes, and so we ran that power point and since then we’ve been creating characters with everyone. Last week we were finishing off peoples characters and seeing who wanted to do what campaign, we had 3 campaigns, mine which is a series of one shots that are usually written the night before, the club runners who has adapted an official campaign (a heist one) then our other friend and current DM who is running one based of his homebrew campaign if I remember correctly. Everyone in my groups characters were finished when last weeks club reached half way so I went up to the club runner and said “hey, my groups all done by the looks of it. Is it alright if I start the campaign?” which is when he turned to me and told me we never actually told them how to play D&D, so I raced over to my laptop and loaded up the PowerPoint and started adding slides left right and centre so that we could start soon. At the time of me writing this post I am what I think is half way through how to actually play. I have a feeling I will have left some stuff out but if it’s important they can ask their DM, if they ask me they’ll probably get this response “ I don’t know ask one of the dudes walking around answering questions.”</p>
